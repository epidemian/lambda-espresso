    ; So, the three basic types of Œª expressions are:
    ; Variables:
    x
    ; Applications:
    x y
    ; And lambda abstractions (also known as functions):
    Œªx.x
    ; If the left-side of an application is an abstraction, then a reduction takes place:
    (Œªx.x) y
    ; That little abstraction at the left is the identity, a very simple function that
    ; just reduces to whatever you apply to it. We can give it a name like so:
    id = Œªx.x
    ; And then just refer it by that name:
    id a
    ; You can apply any kind of Œª expression to an abstraction, like another function:
    id Œªb.c
    ; Or an application:
    id (x y)
    ; Or even the identity function itself:
    id id
    ; That means you can apply identity to itself as many times as you want and it'll still
    ; be identity:
    id id id id id
    ; Notice that applications are left-associative, so the line above is equivalent to:
    ((((id id) id) id) id)

    ; Church numerals

    ; The first few numbers are:
    zero = Œªs.Œªz.z
    one = Œªs.Œªz.s z
    two = Œªs.Œªz.s (s z)
    three = Œªs.Œªz.s (s (s z))
    ; In general, any natural number n can be encoded as:
    ; N = Œªs.Œªz.s (s (s ... (s (s z)) ... ))
    ; with s applied n times.

    ; When we get tired of writing numbers like that, we can define a successor function:
    succ = Œªn.Œªs.Œªz.s (n s z)
    succ three

    ; We can think of Church numerals as functions that apply a given function s to a
    ; given value z a number of times. Zero will apply it 0 times (i.e. it'll give
    ; us z back untouched) and three will call it 3 times.
    ; So, we can represent the addition of numbers m and n as first applying n times s to z,
    ; and then applying m times s to that:
    add = Œªm.Œªn.Œªs.Œªz.m s (n s z)
    add two three
    ; ...or, more succinctly, as applying n times the successor function on m (or vice versa):
    add' = Œªm.Œªn.n succ m
    add' two three
    ; Conversely, we could define the successor function as adding one:
    succ' = add one
    succ' three

    ; Multiplication of m by n is applying m times a function that applies s n times:
    mult = Œªm.Œªn.Œªs.m (n s)
    mult three three
    ; ...or applying m times the addition of n to zero:
    mult' = Œªm.Œªn.m (add n) zero
    mult' three three

    ; Exponentiation n^m has a simple encoding: applying the base m to the exponent n,
    ; which can be understood as applying m successively n times:
    exp = Œªm.Œªn.n m
    exp two three
    ; ...or, alternatively, applying m times the multiplication by n to one:
    exp' = Œªm.Œªn.m (mult n) one
    exp' two three

    ; The encoding for the predecessor function is quite complex.
    ; The Wikipedia article on Church encoding has a good explanation for this term ;-)
    pred = Œªn.Œªs.Œªz.n (Œªf.Œªg.g (f s)) (Œªx.z) (Œªx.x)
    pred three

    ; But given the predecessor function is then easy to define the subtraction:
    sub = Œªm.Œªn.n pred m
    sub three two

    ; To build some predicate functions, we'll use some known boolean terms (see 
    ; Booleans example for more info):
    true = Œªt.Œªf.t
    false = Œªt.Œªf.f
    and = Œªp.Œªq.p q p

    ; To know if a number n is zero we can pass true as the base value and a function
    ; that always returns false (note that the "?" is no special syntax; it's just 
    ; part of the name of the predicate):
    zero? = Œªn.n (Œªx.false) true
    zero? zero
    zero? two

    ; To know if a number is less or equal to another number, we can subtract them and
    ; see if the result is zero:
    leq = Œªm.Œªn.zero? (sub m n)

    ; And given that predicate, numeric equality between m and n can be defined as:
    eq = Œªm.Œªn.and (leq m n) (leq n m)

    ; Throwing everything into the mix, we can prove that 2¬≥ = 3¬≤ - 1:
    eq (exp two three) (pred (exp three two))

    ; Note: for this example we'll use boolean and numeric terms from previous

    ; Also not that these factorial definitions won't work with applicative order ;)

    ; We'd like to be able to define a factorial function as:
    ; fact = Œªn.if (zero? n) one (mult n (fact (pred n)))
    ; But we can't use a term in its own definition.
    ; To achieve recursion, we can instead define a function that will receive itself

    fact-rec = Œªr.Œªn.if (zero? n) one (mult n (r r (pred n)))

    fact = fact-rec fact-rec

    ; The almighty Y Combinator:
    Y = Œªf.(Œªx.f (x x)) (Œªx.f (x x))
