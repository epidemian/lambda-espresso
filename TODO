- Add maximum recursion level option to avoid non-termination problems.
- Add reduction strategy option: normal or applicative.
- Add Eta-reduction option.
- Add collapse/expand reduction steps option.
- Add expand macro (lazy|eager) option.
- Add macros tests.
- Add step-by-step reduction tests.
- Make step-by-step reduction output the reduction type (alpha-conversion, beta-reduction or macro-expansion) for each step. Also, maybe add a "highlighting" step to reductions so the GUI can show which variables and terms where substituted =D
- Improve index.html
  - Save options and code in localStorage.
  - Use some binding library like Knockout.js to keep the DOM on-sync more easily :)
- Add examples to tests
- Add more examples:
  - Numerals
  - Lists (or ranges)
  - Some recursion example. E.g. Fibonacci or Factorial.
  - Prime number generator? (IDK if division is implementable though...)
  - FizzBuzz http://experthuman.com/programming-with-nothing (or a subset of it)

Minor (but fun):
- Change styling of reductions to use :last or those kind of selector instead of manually adding a <b> tag at the end.
- Use CoffeeScript to deifne the grammar instead of a Jison grammar file
