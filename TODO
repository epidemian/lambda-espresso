- Add Eta-reduction option.
- Add expand macro (lazy|eager) option.
- Add step-by-step reduction tests.
- Add highlighting to the step-by-step reduction so the GUI can show which variables and terms where substituted =D
- Improve index.html
  - Save options and code in localStorage.
  - Use some binding library like Knockout.js to keep the DOM on-sync more easily :)
- Add examples to tests
- Add more examples:
  - Lists (or ranges)
  - Prime number generator? (IDK if division is implementable though...)
  - FizzBuzz http://experthuman.com/programming-with-nothing (or a subset of it)
- Add options to generated links.
- Eagerly reduce macros' definitions (or not...)
- Do not expand/collapse reductions just by clicking; it's annoying if you try to select some text.
- Use trampolining to avoid "too much recursion" errors
- Add "about" page/dialog with a brief description of what this is and how it was done.

Minor (but fun):
- Change styling of reductions to use :last or those kind of selector instead of manually adding a <b> tag at the end.

- Add references to nice intro material to Lambda Calculus:
