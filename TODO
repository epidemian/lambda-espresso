- Add reduction strategy option: normal or applicative.
- Add Eta-reduction option.
- Add collapse/expand reduction steps option.
- Add expand macro (lazy|eager) option.
- Add macros tests.
- Add step-by-step reduction tests.
- Add highlighting to the step-by-step reduction so the GUI can show which variables and terms where substituted =D
- Improve index.html
  - Save options and code in localStorage.
  - Use some binding library like Knockout.js to keep the DOM on-sync more easily :)
- Add examples to tests
- Add more examples:
  - Lists (or ranges)
  - Prime number generator? (IDK if division is implementable though...)
  - FizzBuzz http://experthuman.com/programming-with-nothing (or a subset of it)
- Add options to generated links.
- Substitute reduction result by macro name if it is α-equivalent to some macro.
  If more than one macro is α-equivalent, show them all (e.g. "ZERO/FALSE")
- Let macros be defined after their usage.
- Eagerly reduce macros' definitions (or not...)
- Do not expand/collapse reductions just by clicking; it's annoying if you try to select some text.

Minor (but fun):
- Change styling of reductions to use :last or those kind of selector instead of manually adding a <b> tag at the end.
- Use CoffeeScript to deifne the grammar instead of a Jison grammar file
